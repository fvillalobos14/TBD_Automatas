# TBD_Automatas
Project for Theory of Computation.

The project's requirements include:
-   Being capable of parsing an input automata (a json file), whether it is a DFA, NFA, or NFA-ε
-   Creating a data structure that holds the automata's data. These data include: type of automata, states, initial state, final state(s), alphabet, transition table.
-   Transforming a Regular Expression to a DFA
-   Transforming a NFA to a DFA
-   Transforming a NFA-ε to a NFA
-   Checking if an input string belongs to the automata's language.
